# Alexandra-Kaplan.github.io
I am Alexandra Kaplan (Ali for short). I am a sophomore **Journalism** major at **Lehigh University** and I am using this page to post projects and activties that I do in my data journalism class. I am from a small town in northern New Jersey called Wyckoff. I decided to come to Lehigh because of its short distance from home which makes it easy to visit my family frequency, and its beautiful campus/rigorous academics. I love to bake and walk which are two hobbies that I took up in quarantine.
