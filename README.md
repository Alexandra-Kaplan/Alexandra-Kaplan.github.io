I am Alexandra Kaplan (Ali for short). I am a sophomore **Journalism** major at **Lehigh University** and I am using this page to post projects and activities that I do in my data journalism class. I am from a small town in northern New Jersey called Wyckoff. I decided to come to Lehigh because of its short distance from home which makes it easy to visit my family frequently, and its beautiful campus/rigorous academics. A fun fact about me is that my mom and grandpa went to Lehigh's rival school–Lafayette (they make fun of me for choosing Lehigh instead). I love to bake and walk which are two hobbies that I took up in quarantine! 

I am in the College of Arts and Sciences at Lehigh and hope to obtain a minor in both marketing and psychology. I am involved in Greek Life on campus and I am also apart of an online magazine called **The FIT**.  I write for the **Brown and White** which is the student run newspaper at Lehigh. I am an associate sports editor.

# Where Do Lehigh Undergraduate Students Live?

This is an infographic about where undergraduate students at Lehigh live on campus. I used the wbesite Canva.com to create this page, and the data source that I used is [Student Enrollment at Lehigh](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf). The most common place on campus for students to live is in residence halls (this is probably due to the requirement for first and second year students to live on campus). Sororities and fraternities make up some of the lowest numbers due to the fraction of students that actually participate in Greek Life at Lehigh. The off-campus number consists of students that are mostly Juniors and Seniors that do not choose to live in their sorority/fraternity house if they are a part of an organization. This information might help a prospective student gain insight on their living location from year-to-year if they choose to attend this University.

# Which Mental Health Issues are Negatively Impacting the Academic Performance of College Students? 

This is an infographic about student mental health issues. Specifically, this relates to college students and academic success in a survey taken in 2015. The most common type of issue that college students reported was stress. Following stress, anxiety and sleep difficulties come in. Lastly, 14% of students reported that depression is a reason for academic problems in school. These four categories were the largest influencers of academic struggle. The data source that I used is [Consequences of Student Mental Health Issues](https://www.sprc.org/colleges-universities/consequences). The source also included information about the consequences for the student, others, campuses, communities, and larger society as well. I chose this data set because as a college student, I can relate to many of these stressors in relation to my success and grades. I feel like this is at topic that is not talked about enough, and individuals can benefit from accessing this data in a way that is both easy to undertand and informative/relevant. The data was collected by the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, which is a federally founded organization and a reliable source.

# Trader Joes Employee Degree Level

![Trader Joes Employee Degree Level](https://github.com/Alexandra-Kaplan/Alexandra-Kaplan.github.io/blob/main/TraderJoes.png?raw=true)

This is another horizontal bar chart made with [Chart Builder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/). about the degree level of employees that work at the popular supermarket Trader Joes. The categories range from a high school diploma to a masters degree and includes degree types in between. The majority of TJ employees have a bachelors degree, and the the minority of employees have thier masters/other. This data may be helpful to look at through a horizontal bar chart for several reasons–a potential employee may want to access information about what kind of degree they may want/need to gain a position at the store. Additionally, it is interesting to note that the majority of workers have a college degree: Both bachelors and masters degrees make up 57% of total employees. This might surprise some people, considering the assumption that people who work in grocery stores are mostly uneducated individuals or teenagers. This also gives some insight about how the Trader Joes chain may be different from other supermarkets or hint at their recent success within the past decade or so. All of the data pertaining to Trader Joes was found on [Zippia.com](https://www.zippia.com/trader-joe-s-jobs/demographics/).
