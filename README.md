I am Alexandra Kaplan (Ali for short). I am a sophomore **Journalism** major at **Lehigh University** and I am using this page to post projects and activties that I do in my data journalism class. I am from a small town in northern New Jersey called Wyckoff. I decided to come to Lehigh because of its short distance from home which makes it easy to visit my family frequently, and its beautiful campus/rigorous academics. A fun fact about me is that my mom and grandpa went to Lehigh's rival schoolâ€“Lafayette (they make fun of me for choosing Lehigh instead). I love to bake and walk which are two hobbies that I took up in quarantine! 

I am in the College of Arts and Sciences at Lehigh and hope to obtain a minor in both marketing and psychology. I am involved in Greek Life on campus and I am also apart of an online magazine called **The FIT**.  I write for the **Brown and White** which is the student run newspaper at Lehigh. I am an associate sports editor.

# Where Do Lehigh Undergraduate Students Live?

This is an infographic about where undergraduate students at Lehigh live on campus. I used the wbesite Canva.com to create this page, and the data source that I used is [Student Enrollment at Lehigh](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf). The most common place on campus for students to live is in residence halls (this is probably due to the requirement for first and second year students to live on campus). Sororities and fraternities make up some of the lowest numbers due to the fraction of students that actually participate in Greek Life at Lehigh. The off-campus number consists of students that are mostly Juniors and Seniors that do not choose to live in their sorority/fraternity house if they are a part of an organization. This information might help a prospective student gain insight on their living location from year-to-year if they choose to attend this University.
