I am Alexandra Kaplan (Ali for short). I am a sophomore **Journalism** major at **Lehigh University** and I am using this page to post projects and activities that I do in my data journalism class. I am from a small town in northern New Jersey called Wyckoff. I decided to come to Lehigh because of its short distance from home which makes it easy to visit my family frequently, and its beautiful campus/rigorous academics. A fun fact about me is that my mom and grandpa went to Lehigh's rival school–Lafayette (they make fun of me for choosing Lehigh instead). I love to bake and walk which are two hobbies that I took up in quarantine! 

I am in the College of Arts and Sciences at Lehigh and hope to obtain a minor in both marketing and psychology. I am involved in Greek Life on campus and I am also apart of an online magazine called **The FIT**.  I write for the **Brown and White** which is the student run newspaper at Lehigh. I am an associate sports editor.

# Where Do Lehigh Undergraduate Students Live?

This is an infographic about where undergraduate students at Lehigh live on campus. I used the wbesite Canva.com to create this page, and the data source that I used is [Student Enrollment at Lehigh](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf). The most common place on campus for students to live is in residence halls (this is probably due to the requirement for first and second year students to live on campus). Sororities and fraternities make up some of the lowest numbers due to the fraction of students that actually participate in Greek Life at Lehigh. The off-campus number consists of students that are mostly Juniors and Seniors that do not choose to live in their sorority/fraternity house if they are a part of an organization. This information might help a prospective student gain insight on their living location from year-to-year if they choose to attend this University.

# Which Mental Health Issues are Negatively Impacting the Academic Performance of College Students? 

This is an infographic about student mental health issues. Specifically, this relates to college students and academic success in a survey taken in 2015. The most common type of issue that college students reported was stress. Following stress, anxiety and sleep difficulties come in. Lastly, 14% of students reported that depression is a reason for academic problems in school. These four categories were the largest influencers of academic struggle. The data source that I used is [Consequences of Student Mental Health Issues](https://www.sprc.org/colleges-universities/consequences). The source also included information about the consequences for the student, others, campuses, communities, and larger society as well. I chose this data set because as a college student, I can relate to many of these stressors in relation to my success and grades. I feel like this is at topic that is not talked about enough, and individuals can benefit from accessing this data in a way that is both easy to undertand and informative/relevant. The data was collected by the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, which is a federally founded organization and a reliable source.

# Lafayette Lehigh Rivalry

This is a timeline about the long-standing rivalry between Lehigh University and Lafayette College. The timeline represents various points in the history of the rivalry that are the most noteworthy or memorable. Some examples of this include the first game, the longest run, the overtime catch, the 150th game, and the most recent game which was cancelled due to the pandemic. As shown, some years Lafayette will dominate while others, Lehigh takes the victory. The information about the games was obtained from this [Wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rivalry_(Lafayette%E2%80%93Lehigh)) site.

# Instagram Milestones  

This is a timeline about the milestones of the app **Instagram**. This timelines represents some big moments for the app in terms of growth, development, and changes in features. Looking through this timelines is a fun way to see how instagram has become such a big part of society. Additionally, it is interesting to see how the app takes inspiration from other sites and competes with them to stay relevant in the social media world. Information about instagram for this timelines was gathered from this [Wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Instagram)  page!

# Lehigh Undergraduate Involvement 

![Lehigh Undergraduate Involvement](https://github.com/Alexandra-Kaplan/Alexandra-Kaplan.github.io/blob/main/LehighUndergraduateInvolvement.png?raw=true)

This is a horizontal bar chart that was made in [Chart Builder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/). This data pertains to the percentages of undergraduate Lehigh students per college that enrolled in 2019. The chart shows the most enrollment for the College of Arts and Sciences, and the least enrollment for General College Div. This chart can help visualize the amount of students in each college at the University in simpler terms, and give insight to the most popular versus least popular colleges at Lehigh.

# Trader Joes Employee Degree Level

![Trader Joes Employee Degree Level](https://github.com/Alexandra-Kaplan/Alexandra-Kaplan.github.io/blob/main/Trader_Joes_Employees_Degree_Level_2021_Percentage_of_Employees_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

This is another horizontal bar chart made with [Chart Builder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/) about the degree level of employees that work at the popular supermarket Trader Joes in 2021. The categories range from a high school diploma to a masters degree and includes degree types in between. The majority of TJ employees have a bachelors degree, and the the minority of employees have their masters/other. This data may be helpful to look at through a horizontal bar chart for several reasons–a potential employee may want to access information about what kind of degree they may want/need to gain a position at the store. Additionally, it is interesting to note that the majority of workers have a college degree: Both bachelors and masters degrees make up 57% of total employees. This might surprise some people, considering the assumption that people who work in grocery stores are mostly uneducated individuals or teenagers. This also gives some insight about how the Trader Joes chain may be different from other supermarkets or hint at their recent success within the past decade or so. All of the data pertaining to Trader Joes was found on [Zippia.com](https://www.zippia.com/trader-joe-s-jobs/demographics/).

# Time Series Chart Practice
![Time Series Chart Practice](https://github.com/Alexandra-Kaplan/Alexandra-Kaplan.github.io/blob/main/practice.png?raw=true)

Here is a chart that we did in class to practice a time series chart. This chart shows the change over time from 2017-2020 about enrollment in different colleges at Lehigh University. A reader can learn that the Engineering College over time has had the most decrease. Additionally, Arts and Sciences appears to have the most variation over the past 5 years. Business has remained relatively stable. This chart was made with [Chart Builder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/) and the data gathered for the Lehigh enrollment information was collected from [University Profile](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/university-profile)

# Scatterplot Practice
![GDP & Life Satisfaction](https://github.com/Alexandra-Kaplan/Alexandra-Kaplan.github.io/blob/main/GDP_&_Life_Satisfaction_Scatterplot_Life_satisfaction_in_Cantril_Ladder_(World_Happiness_Report_2019)_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

Here is a chart that we did in class to practice a scatterplot chart. This charts shows information about the GDP per capita in 19 different countries. The motivation behind this project was to practice using [Chart Builder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/) to form a scatterplot from data from [2017 Life Satisfaction per captia data set](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GqouSzpED6AiwiO778FcIerDmM27A0sXcteGO7Dvad8/edit#gid=0). Some major findings from this chart is that as GDP increases for countries, life satisfaction seemed to increase as well. This scatterplot can show a positive correlation between GDP and life Satisfaction, hence the upward trend in the chart.

# Early Decision Acceptance Rates at Ivy Leagues 
![Early Decision Acceptance Rates at Ivy Leagues](https://github.com/Alexandra-Kaplan/Alexandra-Kaplan.github.io/blob/main/Early_Decision_Acceptance_Rates_Harvard_Yale_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

This is a time series chart that displays the early decision acceptance rates from the Ivy League Colleges Harvard and Yale within the past ten years. This chart was made using [Chart Builder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/). The data was gathered [Top Tier Admissions](https://toptieradmissions.com/). Specifically, the Harvard data was gathered from [Harvard University: Acceptance Rates and Statistics](https://toptieradmissions.com/resources/college-admissions-statistics/harvard-university-acceptance-rates/) and the Yale data was gathered from [Yale: Acceptance Rates and Statistics](https://toptieradmissions.com/resources/college-admissions-statistics/yale-acceptance-rates/). The spreadsheet that I constructed myself to combine the data points is [College Time Series Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1og2LzzJn9JSDtqBHEvPNXcnRfjTsLCzbkVYqw3C8WHQ/edit?usp=sharing). It can be helpful to look at this information using a time series chart because it can demonstrate the changes in difficulty of the acceptance rate at various points in time. Additionally, it helps put the two different Universities in comparison. Over time, the ability to get into both Harvard and Yale early decision has seemed to only become more difficult. They started out at fairly similar rates, 32.45% in 2016. Today, Harvard's rate is lower than Yales, and the lowest it has ever been at 7.41%. This information can imply that Harvard and Yale are generally similar in admissions rates, and that as the years go on, the rates of acceptance seem to only be getting increasingly more competitive for students. 

# Using Maps Practice

This is a map that helps to describe the 20 most bike-friendly cities on the planet. This map was used with this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jsz3QCo9L2ui5tBlEg-5fRx3hHIwVz2yVYOfLnprX_M/edit#gid=0) and the information from the spreadsheet was obtained from [Wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/most-bike-friendly-cities-2019-copenhagenize-design-index/). Something notable about this map is that it is clear that the most friendly cities have a trend of being in Europe as opposed to other areas around the world.

# World's Happiest Countries
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1ot6gcRcblmq8Lxubd3ftFoeXv6li4gCy" width="640" height="480"></iframe> 

This is a map that helps demonstrate the top 10 happiness reported countries in the world. The data that was used to form this map was taken from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2021/03/19/the-20-happiest-countries-in-the-world-in-2021/?sh=6be679ed70a0). The tool used to create this map is [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/). To gather this data so that it was transferable to the map site, I included the coordinates of each country in my [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jfxui97tUnATd2HuK3ru8dVJ4JLdQcnm0RgQVB4iOmc/edit#gid=0). Some trends on this map display the happiness countries in a clustered area. Most of these countries are located in Europe and specifically Scandanavia. Therefore, the citizens of these countries report higher rates of happiness mostly due to GDP, life expectancy rates, and positive relations between citizens. New Zealand is the only country within this top 10 that is not a European country. Though the pandemic is taken into consideration for this years happiness reports, it seems that the countries that were formerly at the top remain there–citizens that have trust in their governments reported a fairly positive COVID-19 reponse/course of action. A map is an efficient way to represent the data due to this interesting trend of world happiness.
