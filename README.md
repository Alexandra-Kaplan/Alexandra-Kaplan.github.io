I am Alexandra Kaplan (Ali for short). I am a sophomore **Journalism** major at **Lehigh University** and I am using this page to post projects and activties that I do in my data journalism class. I am from a small town in northern New Jersey called Wyckoff. I decided to come to Lehigh because of its short distance from home which makes it easy to visit my family frequently, and its beautiful campus/rigorous academics. A fun fact about me is that my mom and grandpa went to Lehigh's rival schoolâ€“Lafayette (they make fun of me for choosing Lehigh instead). I love to bake and walk which are two hobbies that I took up in quarantine! 

I am in the College of Arts and Sciences at Lehigh and hope to obtain a minor in both marketing and psychology. I am involved in Greek Life on campus and I am also apart of an online magazine called **The FIT**.  I write for the **Brown and White** which is the student run newspaper at Lehigh. I am an associate sports editor.

This is an infographic about where undergraduate students at Lehigh live on campus. I used the wbesite Canva.com to create this page, and the data source that I used is [Student Enrollment at Lehigh](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf)
